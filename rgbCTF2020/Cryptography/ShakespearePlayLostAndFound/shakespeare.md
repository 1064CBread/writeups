# Shakespeare Play, Lost (and found!)
## Challenge Description
File: play

File: some_numbers.txt

## Solution
You are given a text file with pairs of numbers, and what looks like a nonsensical Shakespeare play.
Indexing the numbers into the play (linenum, charnum) gets the flag "itsanrgbtreeeeeee!".
Relevant [code](shakespeare.py)

Additionally, the play is a program in SPL, and running it gives a hint to use a book cipher.
