# Robin's Reddit Password
## Challenge Description
I'm Batman!

Lately Robin's been acting suspicious... I need to see what he's been up to.
Can you get me his reddit password? Just don't try to break into reddit's server...

Tip : Wrap the Password in flag format

## Solution

Assuming that any Reddit thread about passwords would involve someone invoking
a reference to the [hunter2 meme](http://bash.org/?244321), I Googled "robin
hunter2 site:google.com". The [second comment in the top
result](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/78aa07/reddit_host_a_joke_etcpasswd_with_hashes_for/dottnmn/)
gave the answer as "bird."


## Flag

`rgbCTF{bird}`
