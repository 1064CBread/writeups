# Vaporwave 2
## Challenge Description
I got two versions. I got twooo versionsâ€¦

File: vaporwave2b.flac
File: vaporwave2a.flac

## Solution

The two audio files sound very similar, so I figured the flag was probably
hidden in the difference. (This is what I'd originally thought vaporwave1 was
going to be.) Loading the two files in Audacity, screenshotting the respective
spectrograms, and overlaying them in Gimp in Difference mode reveals the flag.

## Flag

`rgbCTF{s3v3r3_1nv3r71g0}`
